# My Dotfiles

[![chezmoi status](https://img.shields.io/badge/managed%20by-chezmoi-brightgreen)](https://chezmoi.io)

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for various tools I use on macOS. It is managed using [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io).

## Overview

This setup includes configurations for:

*   Shell: Zsh (with Oh My Zsh)
*   Terminal Multiplexer: tmux
*   Version Control: Git (including aliases and global ignores)
*   Text Editors: (Potentially Neovim/Vim based on `.ideavimrc`, maybe others in `.config`)
*   Cloud: AWS CLI
*   Rust: Cargo
*   Git TUI: Tig
*   ... and more within the `.config` directory.
